Welcome!

Norii is a 2d turn based strategy game made with Java and LibGDX. I have been working on this on and off since September 2018. Due to a busy personal life I did not find the time to develop this enough and therefore I decided to go open-source, hoping that this will reignite the development.

The end goal I have in mind is a game with tons of different characters with different abilities. The player then selects a team out of these and makes combinations. Stimulating strategic thinking and creativity. Sort of like chess but with abilities and magic.

Norii requires Java 8 - [download it here](https://www.java.com/en/download/). Also make sure that your graphics card driver is up to date.

In order to help coding, simply 

- fork the repo

- import as gradle project
